      <h1>If I Were A Boy</h1>

      <p>&quot;If I Were a Boy&quot; is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé for her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). It was written by BC Jean and Toby Gad, who also handled its production alongside Knowles. Inspired by the difficult break-up of a romantic relationship, the song was initially recorded by Jean, whose record company rejected it. </p>
      <p>Knowles then recorded her own version. Jean was upset when she learned that Knowles was releasing it as a single, but eventually they reached an agreement. &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot; was released by Columbia Records on October 12, 2008, as the album's lead single alongside &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot;. The two songs showcased the contrast between Knowles' personality and her aggressive onstage persona, Sasha Fierce. A Spanish version of the song, titled &quot;Si Yo Fuera un Chico&quot;, was digitally released in Mexico and Spain. &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot; is a pop introspective ballad which draws influences from folk rock through its instrumentation of which includes acoustic guitars, drums and strings. </p>
      <p>The song's lyrics lament the misunderstandings between the genders and indict the male side of relationships. &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot; was generally well received by critics, who complimented Knowles' tormented and emotive vocal performance and called the song her best work to date. The single was a commercial success as it placed in the top ten on twenty-five different singles charts.[1] It topped the charts in more than eight European countries, including the United Kingdom, where it is Knowles' best-selling single. &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot; peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and earned multi-platinum certifications in Australia, Canada, and the US. </p>
      <p>The accompanying music video for &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot; was directed by Jake Nava and shot in black-and-white. With a theme of role reversal, it is conceptually similar to the American comedy film Freaky Friday (1976). A video for the Spanish version of the ballad was edited from the original clip. Knowles promoted &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot; through live performances at venues including The Oprah Winfrey Show, the 52nd Grammy Awards, and the I Am... World Tour (2009–10). The song has been covered several times on televised music competitions. American singer Reba McEntire sang a country version of the ballad on Country Music Television (CMT), and a studio version was released as the second single from her 2010 album, All the Women I Am.</p>
