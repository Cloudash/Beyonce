      <p>&quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot; is a dance-pop and R&amp;B song from American singer Beyoncé's third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). Columbia Records released &quot;Single Ladies&quot; as a single on October 13, 2008 alongside &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot;, showcasing the contrast between Beyoncé and her aggressive onstage alter ego Sasha Fierce. It explores the unwillingness of men to propose. In the song, the female protagonist is in a club to celebrate. Most music critics praised the song's smooth production and some noted its similarity to Beyoncé's 2007 single &quot;Get Me Bodied&quot;. &quot;Single Ladies&quot; won three Grammy Awards in 2010, among other accolades.</p>
      <p> Several news media sources named it as one of the best songs of 2008, while some considered it one of the best songs of the decade. It topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and has been certified quadruple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with more than 5 million paid digital downloads. The song charted among the top ten within the singles category in several other countries. Globally, it was 2009's seventh best-selling digital single with over 6.1 million copies sold and is one of the best-selling singles of all time. A black-and-white music video accompanied the single's release. It won several awards, including the Video of the Year at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. Beyoncé has performed &quot;Single Ladies&quot; on television and during her concert tours. The song and particularly its music video have been widely parodied and imitated. Several notable artists have performed cover versions. Media usage has included placement in popular television shows.</p>
      <p>&quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot; was written by Beyoncé, Terius &quot;The-Dream&quot; Nash, Thaddis &quot;Kuk&quot; Harrell, and Christopher &quot;Tricky&quot; Stewart, and was produced by Nash and Stewart. Beyoncé recorded the song in April 2008 at the The Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized &quot;Single Ladies&quot; after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was &quot;the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage&quot;, and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that &quot;people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate&quot;.</p>
      <p>She stated that although &quot;Single Ladies&quot; is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day. In &quot;Single Ladies&quot;, Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am... Sasha Fierce The song was released simultaneously with &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot;; as lead singles, they were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities of the singer. This reinforced the theme of the album, which was created by placing its ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs. The singles debuted on US radio on October 8, 2008; &quot;Single Ladies&quot; did so on mainstream urban New York radio station Power 105.1.</p>
      <p> Both singles were added to rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on October 12, 2008;&quot;Single Ladies&quot; was sent to urban contemporary playlists the same day, while &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot; was instead classified for contemporary hit radio. The two songs were released as a double A-side single on November 7, 2008, in Australia,New Zealand, and Germany. Dance remixes of the song were made available in the US on February 10, 2009, and in Europe on February 16, 2009.&quot;Single Ladies&quot; was not originally released as a single in the UK, but the song became increasingly popular there and reached the top ten in the UK Singles Chart as a result of download sales.On February 16, 2009, it was released as a CD single, and the dance remixes became available as a digital download.</p>
