      <h1>On The Run Tour</h1>
      <p><img src="../images/on-the-run-tour.jpg" width="150" height="150"></p>
      <p>The On the Run Tour was the co-headlining stadium tour by American performer Beyoncé and rapper Jay-Z. The joint tour came shortly after the two had finished their own solo tours; Beyoncé's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013–2014) and Jay-Z's Magna Carter World Tour (2013–2014).</p>
      <p> The tour name spins off from the 2013 song &quot;Part II (On the Run)&quot;, included on Jay-Z's album Magna Carta Holy Grail, on which Beyoncé features. An official poster for the tour was released along with the announcement of the venture, showing Beyoncé and Jay-Z embracing whilst dressed in black ski masks, following the criminal &quot;on the lam&quot; narrative found in the couples' 2002 first single together, &quot;'03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot; and &quot;Part II (On the Run)&quot;. To promote the tour, a faux movie trailer video was premiered in May 2014 entitled &quot;Run&quot; (stylized as &quot;RUN&quot;). The video, which features eight celebrity cameo appearances, showcases the couple in a variety of Bonnie and Clyde style, action and gun packed situations.</p>
      <p> The tour itself was noted to follow this same theme throughout, with similar video interludes incorporated into the production of the show. Critics generally lauded the tour, praising the extravagant set list, dynamic and detailed theme and story of the show and both artists' performance abilities, however some felt the on stage chemistry between the couple was not what it could have been. Due to the large demand and tickets selling out in minutes in multiple locations, extra tour dates were added to the itinerary. </p>
      <p>The tour became a commercial success, grossing $95 million in the first 19 North American shows and $109.7 million in total, as well as attendance totalling at 978,781. The tour was the 5th highest grossing of 2014, according to Pollstar's annual year end tour chart. The show was broadcast in its entirety on September 20, 2014, airing on the US television network HBO, following the taping of the two concerts in Paris, France, where the tour concluded.</p>
      <h2>Development </h2>
      <p>The tour was &quot;conceived and launched fast compared to most stadium tours&quot; according to Live Nation, who noted that most tours of this nature take more than a year of planning, compared to the On the Run Tour that took around one month. &quot;It came together quite quickly, around mid-March,&quot; Omar Al-Joulani of Live Nation North America commented. &quot;By April, we had everything together, and once the routing was in place we had about three weeks until the tour was announced.&quot; Following the general sale of tour dates, fans were left concerned as the July 11, 2014 show in East Rutherford, New Jersey remained pending to go on sale for many weeks, despite all other dates already being available to the public. </p>
      <p>Some reports stated that the reason for this was that the state of New Jersey had implemented a legislation resulting in 95% of tickets for an event having to be available to the public. The show was eventually put on sale to the public on June 4, 2014. The On the Run Tour was the first tour to be a part of &quot;Official Events&quot; – the collaboration of Facebook and Live Nation in which the size and scale of Ticketmaster's database is leveraged as events promoted by Live Nation are imported to Artists' Facebook Pages as &quot;Official Events&quot;, providing fans with direct links to Ticketmaster to purchase verified tickets.]The tour was stated to have a running theme throughout the performances of being &quot;on the run&quot; by the Miami New Times, whether it is from &quot;the media, their place in pop music, the haters, the bullshit and sometimes even each other&quot;. </p>
      <p>When explaining the concept of the tour and its accompanying videos in a telephone conversation to New York-based director Dikayal Rimmasch, Jay-Z stated &quot;We’re not trying to do this literally, it’s not that we’re Bonnie and Clyde. We’re on the run from everything. On the run from becoming a cliché. On the run from doing the same thing again.&quot;]During their individual performances, Beyoncé was often backed by both male and female dancers and Jay-Z was noted to hold the stage for multiple songs without assistance. Beyoncé was backed by an all female band during her solo songs, whilst Jay-Z was accompanied by other male instrumentalists; however both artist's musicians collaborated for the majority of the performance. Video interludes filled with &quot;cop chases and other violent outbursts&quot; carried the storytelling between songs. </p>
      <p>The performances of the joint tour was said to be split up similarly to Jay-Z's previous joint venture with Kanye West, the Watch the Throne Tour. Beyoncé and Jay-Z would take turn holding down the stage, beginning with several songs by Beyoncé first, followed by duets and afterwards Jay-Z rapping his songs. Both artists sported multiple outfits from a variety of fashion designers throughout the performances of the tour. In Beyoncé's case, makeup artist Sir John Barnette commented on her quick changes backstage between performances, comparing them to &quot;Daytona 500&quot; with every member of her team working on a separate part of her look </p>
